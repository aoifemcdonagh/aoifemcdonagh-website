                <p>Hi, I'm Aoife. </p>

                <p>Born in Texas, and mostly raised in Ireland, I never know where to say I'm from.</p>
                <p>I started making this website as a way to keep busy while unemployed during the covid lockdown. Back in early March, I left Ireland for what was supposed to be a year spent exploring the world. Travelling lasted about 2 weeks before I ended up locked down in New Zealand. Not a bad spot to be stranded in fairness. Just under two months after leaving Ireland, I was back home again and very much grounded.</p>
                <p>Without the usual distractions to occupy myself with, life in lockdown was pretty challenging. Creating my own website helped me to focus my seemingly unlimited time on something productive. I learned new skills, improved on old ones, and got something to show off in the end. A win all round!</p>
                <p>Initially I had planned to use this website to help me get a job. It would be an expanded CV of sorts. But as it happened, I was employed before I finished the website! Who says 2020 was all bad. Stripped of its original purpose, this website might change track soon. Despite not being the most efficient writer, or having the most profound insights to offer, I've toyed with the idea of writing a blog for a few years now. Who knows, maybe I'll do it.</p>
                <p>Thanks for popping by. I love visitors.</p>
